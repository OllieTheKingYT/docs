# Velto Specification

The **Velto Documentation** defines how people use the Velto Markup Language — its syntax, structure, tags, attributes, events, and the rules that govern how Velto documents must be interpreted.

This repository is the *source of truth* for the Velto language.  
All runtimes, tools, editors, and implementations must follow this specification.

## 📘 Purpose

Velto is a lightweight, declarative UI language built on custom tags and predictable behaviour.  
The goal of this specification is to:

- Define the Velto file format (`.velto`)
- Describe the syntax rules and parsing model
- Standardise built‑in tags and their semantics
- Define attribute behaviour and event handling
- Provide a stable contract for Velto runtimes
- Enable consistent behaviour across implementations
